						Writing UX&#160;copies can be&#160;a&#160;little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we&#160;are unsure about how to&#160;get the right word.
						To&#160;crack the code for the UX&#160;copies, we&#160;at&#160;Zeta Design wanted to&#160;build a&#160;Figma plugin for the larger design community. The
						plugin is&#160;called the Ghost UXWriter and has a&#160;set of&#160;UX&#160;copies cataloged and categorized with a&#160;voice and tone variation ranging from
						plain, casual to&#160;playful. The intention to&#160;build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, &#8216;Designing voice and tone for error
						messages.
